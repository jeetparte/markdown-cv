## Summary

I am a Junior Software Developer with 1+ years of professional experience in C#, object-oriented programming and SQL.

## Skills

### Programming Languages

<!-- 1 -->
<!-- These are the languages I use everday at work: -->

1. **C#**
    * I spend a lot of my time here.
    * Currently, my favorite object-oriented language.

2. **SQL**
    * While SQL is declarative, I have found that sometimes that abstraction breaks!

3. **Oracle PL/SQL**
    * A procedural wrapper over SQL is really convenient.
    * One time, I had to insert a lot of records in the database. Using the Bulk SQL features, minimised context switching between the SQL and PL/SQL engines and this optimisation helped prevent out of memory errors!

I've learn these in the past -->

4. **Swift**
    * I like Swift for it's concise yet expressive syntax. A stark contrast to the verbosity of Java.
    * Protocol-oriented programming is an interesting paradigm. I would like to explore it further.
5. **Java**
    <!-- * Why do I think Java is verbose? Maybe it was, when I was first introduced to it many years ago during high school. -->
    * This was my first programming language. I learnt it during high school.

### Environments

* **macOS**
* **Windows**

### IDEs

* **Visual Studio**
* **Xcode**
* **Eclipse**

### Version control
